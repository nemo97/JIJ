# How to Contribute?

Anyone can contribute to this site by sharing ideas, creating content, and more. To contribute, a basic level of technical knowledge is required to configure the application, write content, and verify the changes.

Please create a ticket in the project section on GitHub. In the future, we plan to create a video tutorial demonstrating how to set up the application and contribute effectively.
